**Day 12 -  Agile and Final Project Planning**

**Welcome class. Take any questions about React (10 min)**

1. **Agile Methodology**

    1. **Just like we learned that components allow us to split up a big project into smaller parts, those parts have to coded in an order method.**

    2. **When a team of developers works together to code, typically they use something called Agile to make the process speedy and efficient.**

    3. **Each application is broken down into smaller parts or modules. Each group of modules is put into an increment of time called a "sprint".**

    5. **Basic workflow:  Plan > Design > Build > Test > Review > Launch**

2. **Building a Github project board**

    6. **Github projects is a system that allows you to create a masonry (card) based layout for tracking project information.**

    7. **you can use it for any kind of project or information, but it can be really useful because it has plugins that can be tailored to a development workflow**

    8. **[https://github.com/breatheco-de/assets/projects/3]**(https://github.com/breatheco-de/assets/projects/3)

    9. **Let’s go to Github and create an repository and a project "Kanban Automated". (allow time for them to set up)**

3. **Building a Kanban Automated Project**

    10. **The type of project that you will use as a developer is called a Kanban Automated.**

    11. **This is a workflow style board that allows you to track the various stages of the development process of any github issue.**

    12. **Columns are typically as follows:**

        1. **Backlog - This is a column that represents all of the items you’d like to see in your application (will not develop currently, but want to in the future)**

        2. **Selected for Development - Contains the items that you have selected to develop overall**

        3. **In Progress - These are items in the current sprint that have been pulled forward and are being worked on**

        4. **QA - Modules that are completed and need to be reviewed via Quality Assurance Testing**

        5. **Done - Completed**

4. **Creating the project Backlog**

    13. **To create all of the cards, you have to start with creating User Stories**

    14. **User stories help you to understand the feature, who it benefits, and how.**

5. **Who to write the story**

    15. **[https://breatheco.de/en/lesson/creating-user-stories/]**(https://breatheco.de/en/lesson/creating-user-stories/)

    16. **The story typically follows a pattern: **As a [role], I can [feature] so that [reason]

6. **Acceptance Criteria**

    1.  **When you set up a card, you have to implement Acceptance Criteria**

    2.  **This is the desired features or functions that should be possible when testing the component during your QA phase.**

    3.  **If during QA, your card fails to meet the AC, it will be sent back with notes of how or why it failed so that you can fix the issue.**

    4.  **Example: I can purchase an album with my VISA card**

7. **You application roles & capabilities**

    1.  **Since the cards involve Role’s, you have to decide who the stories will be from**

    2.  **Can be things like Account owner, site administrator, SEO Specialist, Customer, etc.**

    3.  **Each type of role will depend on the type of application you create and who you invision using the software.**

    4.  **When you create these roles, you may even want to create a key that explains the role (if it isn’t that intuitive at first glance)**

8. **Standup Meeting**

    1.  **During a standup meeting, you will typically be asked the following questions:**

        1. **What did you accomplish since the last meeting? (wins)**

        2. **What are you working on until the next meeting? (goals)**

        3. **What is getting in your way or keeping you from doing your job? (rocks/impediments)**

    2.  **Small problems should always be addressed so that they don’t turn into big problems.**

    3.  **Everything you say should be valuable to everyone in the room.**

        1. **This means you should keep it relevant to the team and project overall.**

        2.  **Individual talks can happen at any time of the day aside from the stand up meeting, So feel free to follow up with individuals at a later time.**

    4.  **Meetings should be short (usually 15 min at most) and happen daily.**

    5.  **They are supposed to improve communication, help overcome obstacles, and motivate the team.**
