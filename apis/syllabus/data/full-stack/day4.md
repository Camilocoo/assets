**Day 4 - Command Line Interface**

**Welcome everyone, Check if they were able to finish the Bootstrap Instagram.**

**Lecture**

* Explain how computers can be entirely managed without a windows interface, you can do everything from the command line. 

* [Here they can find a cheat sheet with the most used commands.](https://breatheco.de/en/lesson-asset/command-line-or-bash-cheat-sheet/)

* Make sure to make students understand how important the command line (developers use it every day all the time and it is impossible to avoid).

* Relative path vs absolute path.

* Explain that we are in cloud 9, which uses ubuntu and we have to familiarize we the ubuntu command line.

* Talk about the file hierarchy and how is represented in the command line, what the dot  .  and double dot  ..  represents. Draw on the board a file hierarchy and show if at the same time how the command line shows it (compare both).

* Explain the use of the autocomplete command: [using tab one time for autocomplete or two times to show options](https://www.howtogeek.com/195207/use-tab-completion-to-type-commands-faster-on-any-operating-system/).

* Some applications are command-line-only like GIT, NPM, DJANGO (Python), COMPOSER, Yarn, BreatheCode CLI, etc.

* This is a [very good series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AO0jzD1hpXc&t=267s&index=8&list=PL8A83A276F0D85E70) explaining the command line that students can **watch later.**

1. **Start The CMD Challenge**

    1. **Have students create a project in c9**

    2. **Help them to clone the repo for the project (paste it in the slack channel so they can use the link)**

        1. **git init**

        2. **git clone**

    3. **Run the react presentation on my computer**

2. **Most used CMD commands**

    4. **LS - Lists the contents of the current directory (shows directories and files)**

    5. **CD - Change Directory (navigate to a different directory)**

    6. **MV - Move a file to another folder or directory**

    7. **RM - Deletes a file (not directories)**

    8. **MKDIR - Makes/creates a directory**

    9. **RMDIR - Deletes a directory (not files)**

    10. **CP - Copies a file**

    11. **FIND - Finds a file in the given directory and with the given specifications.**

    12. **You will want to review these and the syntax for the commands from the Day 4 lesson on Command Line.**

3. **File Directory Hierarchy**

    13. **You can use one dot ( . ) to refer to all the files and folders in the hierarchy.**

    14. **You can also use two dots ( .. ) to refer to the parent directory.**

    15. **You can use the forward slash ( / ) to navigate further down in the hierarchy directories.**

    16. **Hidden files:  Usually, a file has a name and an extension (filename.extension).  If a file has no name, but only an extension, it will, by default, be hidden in the visual interface.**

4. **Relative ./ vs Absolute Paths**

    17. **Relative paths provide you with a path , but no fixed drive or website address.**

        3. **Example:   ./file.html**

    18. **Absolute paths provide you with a fixed location to the file or path.**

        4. **Example:**[https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg](https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg)

        5. **Or in the command line:  /home/joe/file.html**

        6. **If you were on a windows machine, this would look like:   C:\users\joe\file.html**

5. **Moving Up a Directory**

    19. **Now that you know the basic commands, can anyone tell me how to move up a directory?**

    20. **To move up a directory you would use the cd command, but specify the parent directory like this:  cd ..**

6. **Autocomplete with TAB**

    21. **When typing a file or folder name in command line, you can use TAB do autocomplete**

    22. **TAB twice will show options**

7. **GIT in a general way**

    23. **What is git?**

        7. **Git is an online, central code storage that allows developers to manage a code base in teams.**

        8. **Some of the things you can do with git include:**

            1. **You can collaborate on projects easily**

            2. **see a history of revisions**

            3. **roll back to previous versions if a revision fails (version control)**

            4. **and even resolve code conflicts so that 2 developers don’t overwrite each other’s code.**

        9. **Git is a necessity to any developer working today as it’s resolved many of the issues of working on a team or keeping version history on a project.**

    24. **Next class we will review GIT in more detail. If you haven’t already, please read the lesson on GIT in the breatheco.de platform.**
