**Day 6 - Wireframes, Sitemaps and Bootstrap Components**

**Welcome everyone, Check if everyone finished their part of the collaborative project.**

**Ask if everyone was able to submit their assignments to breatheco.de.**

**Today we are going to discuss design workflow. There are some major components that are necessary for any design workflow. Let’s discuss the process so that you know what to expect when working with any client.**

1. **Gathering requirements**

    1. **First thing to consider is that you need to gather the requirements for the project.**

    2. **You should start by answering simple questions, such as:**

        1. **What is the client’s budget for the project?**

            1. **this will help you identify if there are any restrictions you need to place when deciding on how much the customer can afford (time, quality, components, extras)**

        2. **What type of project will this be? (basic website, API, react application)**

        3. **Does it need any special items? (CMS, ecommerce, etc)**

        4. **What is the timeframe to complete the project?**

        5. **What is the customers vision for the project?**

            2. **include any relevant details, for example:**

                1. **client would like a user account login with profile page**

                    1. **user should be able to update billing information for use with orders**

            3. **How many pages(or views) and what does each page(or view) represent?**

                2. **example: home, products, about , contact**

            4. **make sure to discuss options that you feel would be a good choice so that you can already start to set the pace of your project.**

    3. **Typically, you will do this before giving an estimate for a project because it will allow you to build your proposal with billing and timeline accurately.**

2. **Website Sitemap & Sections**

    4. **The next thing you should do is to break the project into sections and create a basic site map.**

    5. **This will help you to understand the flow of the website or application. It is also a great way to communicate expectations to your client.**

    6. **Site maps are in essence a basic diagram of the pages/views and how they interconnect.**

    7. **Let’s look at an Example:**  **[https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-abc-chocolate/blob/master/img/sitemap.png]**(https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-abc-chocolate/blob/master/img/sitemap.png)

    8. **You can find a ton of Free online software to accomplish this. Here is an example of a piece of software I came across that looks promising. -** **[https://www.gloomaps.com/]**(https://www.gloomaps.com/)

        6. **Ultimately, you can also build a simple web page for your sitemap.**

        7. **can have divs with text that represent each element (page/view, etc)**

        8. **simple styling in the head using style tag**

3. **Wireframes**

    9. **Once you actually have all information and sitemap, you can create wireframes**

    10. **Wireframes are a structural representation of the elements on a page and their alignments**

        9. **Think of them as blueprints for a house**

    11. **Each element will have a simple graphical representation based on basic shapes and some text**


    13. **Show a second example (from one of my projects)**

        10. **You can use many different programs to create your wireframes when you get in the industry.**

        11. **If you have an adobe account, you can use Adobe XD - which is an industry standard. I use this for mockups, wireframes, and quick prototypes.**

        12. **Until you get a piece of software like that, you can do your wireframes by hand. (many professional designers/developers still do this.**

    14. **At the end of your wireframes, you will generally transition into creating Mockups.**

        13. **These are full color renderings of your wireframes and very closely resemble the final product.**

        14. **These can be done in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe XD, or inVision. There are lots of other programs for creating models or mockups for your site and you should decide on the best one for your tastes.**

        15. **Through my own research and experience, Adobe XD feels the best and works natively with photoshop and illustrator. But inVision has slightly better animation/transition control.**

        16. **There may be slight discrepancies but overall you will create the site based on these drawings.**

4. **Bootstrap Components**

    15. **This was part of our bootstrap workflow.**

    16. **While you create your wireframes, you want to think about things in terms of components, but after you have your design you will need to code them.**

    17. **Gather together all of your components and begin organizing them in terms of the way your wireframes were laid out.**

    18. **When you finished gathering everything, then you will break into your development process and actually code your site.**

**Make sure you let them know that they must read the Javascript lesson before next class and start with the JS Replits.**
