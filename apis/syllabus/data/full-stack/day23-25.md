**Day 23/25 -  Intro PHP, Wordpress, Etc.**

**Welcome class. Quick recap of Json, Fetch, Etc. Today we will be PHP and Wordpress, and later on, how to create custom post types****.**

* **What is Wordpress?**

    * Wordpress is a **CMS (Content Management System)** that allows you to manage all of your website’s data from blog posts, to images, to pages.

    * When coding for wordpress, we typically use a combination of HTML/CSS/JS and PHP.

* **Javascript to PHP**

    * **[https://student.breatheco.de/course/web-development/27/l/from-javascript-to-php]**(https://student.breatheco.de/course/web-development/27/l/from-javascript-to-php)

    * **In terms of functionality, they have NOTHING in common: they don’t serve the same purpose, they don’t do the same things, they come from different backgrounds, etc.**

        * **They do however share the same logical operations**

            * Like in any other programming language, you have loops, while, if..else, switch, etc. (PHP has even more options – we’ll talk about those later).

        * **They also have virtually the same syntax**

            * You have to end every line with a semi-colon; functions are declared the same way; loops are declared the same way; logical operations are the same; etc.

        * **Small differences here and there**

            * Variable declaration - instead of var x, you would just put $x

            * Looping has two forms available that you will come across

                * **Traditional** - way we’ve done until now, enclosing code with the { }

                * **New method** - using :  and then terminating the loop with endif, endwhile, endforeach, etc.

            * **echo statement**

                * **returns text into the document**

                    * can be used to add javascript on the fly

                    * can be used to print a message on the page

                    * can be used to add HTML to page

            * **Object Notation**

                * **In JS, to access properties of objects we use dot notation.**

                    * Example: 
var auxCar = new Car();
console.log(auxCar.brand);

*  **In PHP we would use arrow notation**

    * Example: 
$myCar = new Car();
echo $car->brand;

* **There are repl’its that cover this lesson. Practice, Drill, Repeat - That is how you get better. You have to code to learn.**

* **Database Entities: Modeling Data with Wordpress**

    * **An entity in Wordpress is a Custom Post Type**

    * **When putting together a custom post type, we have to think about the purpose we want it to fill.**

        * What is it for?

        * What custom fields should it have?

        * Will it be related to other post types?

        * How will it be related?

    * **Let’s discuss the Default Wordpress post types**

        * **Author -** defines the author of any given post. Every post has an author which is typically the user that creates the post.

        * **category -** sets up a category for posts. Each blog post has a category it is in. If a category isn’t set, it goes to uncategorized.

        * **tag -** a keyword that relates to one or many posts/pages. You can tag similar posts or topics within posts. These tags are able to be queried later on the front end. It gives more depth to searching through posts.

        * **post -** everything in wordpress ultimately uses posts, but when we talk about the ‘Post’ post type, we are referring to blog posts.

        * **user -** Users in the wordpress system. Users run the CMS, Create the Site, and Create Pages and blog posts.

        * **page -** Pages are web pages on your site. 

* **Installing Tools**

    * Use Composer+WPCLI to install (WordPress + WPAS Dash + ACPT Plugin) and demonstrate how create you own WordPress model.

        * **Famous 5 min install (in seconds)**- [https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/core/install/](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/core/install/) 

        * **Install Composer globally** -
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

* **Wordpress Dash install** - [https://github.com/alesanchezr/wpas-wordpress-dash](https://github.com/alesanchezr/wpas-wordpress-dash) 

    * Do not explain composer that much (do the analogy with NPM) and do not explain WP-CLI to much either, start using it and students will learn by doing

* **The WordPress Dashboard**

    * Explain Dashboard

    * Explain how has PAGES and POSTS, but ultimately, everything is treated as POST in the backend

    * Explain plugins

    * Explain settings

    * Explain editor (Guttenburg) 

* **Creating a CPT**

    * **The initial setup is already done in your Functions.php, let’s look at what is being done**

        * Go over includes

        * Go over Controller init

        * Go over CPT init

    * **To create a Post Type, we need three main things:**

        * **A file that creates the post type (in our types folder)**

            * For this, we simply duplicate the example post type (or retool the current one), changing the name to the name we would like to use for our class, etc.

            * This file also controls events that happen when we initialize the post (like a post constructor)

                * an example would be if you wanted to lock a certain field (like the title) when the post type is loaded.

                * you could then generate the title automatically when the post is saved using your own naming convention.

        * **A file that creates the controller (in our controllers folder)**

            * Just like the post type itself, we duplicate an existing controller and change the naming convention to reflect our post type.

            * Here we can define how we access post data.

            * Typically in Wordpress, we use something called "the loop" and it’s a way of getting data out of the post. However, with wpas-wordpress-dash, we can use MVC.

            * This means that we can declare variables that can be accessed on the front end and import them later for use outside of "the loop".

        * **The correct declarations to define and instantiate it in our functions.php**

            * If you create more than 1 post type, you can duplicate the line that instantiated the first post type and then change the naming to match your new type.

* **Relationships between Custom Post Types**

    * Like we said before, when you are going through creating a post type, it’s important to think on how it will relate to other post types.

    * This will help you to better understand how data should flow through your site.

**ReThink Lesson 23 - Wordpress & Entities**

**Welcome class. Today we are going to discuss Wordpress Installation, Entities, and How to set up your first basic entities in Wordpress with our Boilerplate and ACF plugin.**

* **What is Wordpress?**

    * Wordpress is a powerful** CMS (Content Management System)** that allows you to manage all of your website’s data from blog posts, to images, to pages.

    * Wordpress is used by over 30% of all websites on the internet today!

    * Traditional Wordpress development was based around designing a custom "Theme" using HTML/CSS, Javascript, and PHP.

        * Pages would be integrated php pages that accessed data directly from Wordpress using the traditional Wordpress Posts Loop.

        * Back end changes were made directly in your functions.php file.

    * The method we will be using puts a modern MVC approach on this. 

        * We will be using a Wordpress boilerplate based made by the Academy.

        * We create custom post types/entities and set up controllers for each post type using the structure in the boilerplate.

        * We will define API methods for our GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, as we need.

* **Database Entities: Modeling Data with Wordpress**

    * **An entity in Wordpress is a Custom Post Type**

    * **When putting together a custom post type, we have to think about the purpose we want it to fill.**

        * What is it for?

        * What custom fields should it have?

        * Will it be related to other post types?

        * How will it be related?

    * **Let’s discuss the Default Wordpress post types**

        * **Author -** defines the author of any given post. Every post has an author which is typically the user that creates the post.

        * **category -** sets up a category for posts. Each blog post has a category it is in. If a category isn’t set, it goes to uncategorized.

        * **tag -** a keyword that relates to one or many posts/pages. You can tag similar posts or topics within posts. These tags are able to be queried later on the front end. It gives more depth to searching through posts.

        * **post -** everything in wordpress ultimately uses posts, but when we talk about the ‘Post’ post type, we are referring to blog posts.

        * **user -** Users in the wordpress system. Users run the CMS, Create the Site, and Create Pages and blog posts.

        * **page -** Pages are web pages on your site. 

* **Installing Tools**

    * First we will install Breathecode CLI, then start a wordpress project. Next we install dependencies using composer (similar to NPM) and finally run a wordpress install script.

        * **Start a new workspace, then delete the helloworld and open a new terminal window (close the old one first) so that you have the latest node version.**

        * **Perform the following commands for a Full Wordpress Project Install** - [https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli#startwordpress-project](https://github.com/breatheco-de/breathecode-cli#startwordpress-project) 

            * npm install -g breathecode-cli

            * bc start:wordpress-project -r 

            * composer install

            * bash install.sh

                * Follow installer prompts to install wordpress using WP-CLI

    * **Wait until the whole class has installed WP, Composer, and Wordpress-Hello**

    * Do not explain composer that much (do the analogy with NPM) and do not explain WP-CLI too much either, start using it and students will learn by doing

* **The WordPress Dashboard**

    * Explain Dashboard

    * Explain how has PAGES and POSTS, but ultimately, everything is treated as POST in the backend

    * Explain plugins - there are plugins for everything **(while here, install ACF)**

    * Explain settings - controls all site settings

    * Explain editor (Guttenburg) - allows a new level of page content and customization in new Wordpress sites.

* **Creating a CPT**

    * **The initial setup is already done in your Functions.php, let’s look at what is being done**

        * Everything is included from other files and commented so you know which file contains what

            * API Endpoints config are in your setup_api.php file

            * Controllers registered in your setup_templates.php file

            * Post type registrations are in your setup_types.php file

    * **To create a Post Type, we need three main things:**

        * **A file that creates the post type (in our types folder)**

            * For this, we simply duplicate the example post type (or retool the current one), changing the name to the name we would like to use for our class, etc.

            * This file also controls events that happen when we initialize the post (like a post constructor)

        * **A file that creates the controller (in our controllers folder)**

            * Just like the post type itself, we duplicate an existing controller and change the naming convention to reflect our post type.

            * Here we can define how we access post data. In other words, these are the methods that we will link to our API endpoints.

            * Typically in Wordpress, we use something called "the loop" and it’s a way of getting data out of the post, but in this method we approach queries differently.

                * Let’s look at the getDraftCourses() method

                * They set a query up and assign it to a variable

                * The query looks at the "Course" post type, and filters by status=draft.

                * Then it returns the results of the query (any posts matching)

        * **To call the data from the front end correctly**

            * Let’s look at the index.php file

            * First we define the $args variable to help us load the view data (which let’s us display our data via the controller)

            * Then in the body, you can see how they use it.

            * Name is the variable that was designed in the first method of our controller

            * further down, you see some cool php like get_site_url()

                * this pulls the full path of the site

            * next , you see how to set up your get endpoint link

* **Relationships between Custom Post Types**

    * Like we said before, when you are going through creating a post type, it’s important to think on how it will relate to other post types.

    * This will help you to better understand how data should flow through your site.

**Exercise:** I’d like you to take this time to plan out your custom post types for your site. Think about the data you need, then consider the relationships to each other. I would also like you to create 1 of these custom post types in your project.

**ReThink Lesson 25 - PHP**

**Welcome class. Today we are going to discuss PHP and some of the common code examples you will need for your final project.**

* **From Javascript to PHP**

    * **[https://student.breatheco.de/course/web-development/27/l/from-javascript-to-php]**(https://student.breatheco.de/course/web-development/27/l/from-javascript-to-php)

    * **In terms of functionality, they have NOTHING in common: they don’t serve the same purpose, they don’t do the same things, they come from different backgrounds, etc.**

        * **They do however share the same logical operations**

            * Like in any other programming language, you have loops, while, if..else, switch, etc. (PHP has even more options – we’ll talk about those later).

        * **They also have virtually the same syntax**

            * You have to end every line with a semi-colon; functions are declared the same way; loops are declared the same way; logical operations are the same; etc.

        * **Small differences here and there**

            * Variable declaration - instead of var x, you would just put $x

            * Looping has two forms available that you will come across

                * **Traditional** - way we’ve done until now, enclosing code with the { }

                * **New method** - using :  and then terminating the loop with endif, endwhile, endforeach, etc.

            * **echo statement**

                * **returns text into the document**

                    * can be used to add javascript on the fly

                    * can be used to print a message on the page

                    * can be used to add HTML to page

            * **Object Notation**

                * **In JS, to access properties of objects we use dot notation.**

                    * Example: 
var auxCar = new Car();
console.log(auxCar.brand);

* **In PHP we would use arrow notation**

    * Example: 
$myCar = new Car();
echo $car->brand;

 * **There are repl’its that cover this lesson. Practice, Drill, Repeat - That is how you get better. You have to code to learn.**

* **Code examples:** Let’s cover a few that you will be using

    * **Controller Examples**

        * **Query Methods**

            * To define a query, we set a variable and use the following syntax:
**$query = Course::all([ 'status' => 'draft' ])**


* **Course** is our post type name in this example

    * **::all**allows us to search all posts in the specified post type

        * Then we filter by an array of specifications. In this case, we look for all posts with **status=draft**.

            * **Status** is the key or property we are referring to, **draft** is the value that property is set to in the post.

            * When you are working with these queries, everything in the array is called an **Argument.**

            * These values are then returned by using:
**return $query->posts;**

* **You can modify this to suit your needs.** For example, if I want to search by an ACF field, we could do it as follows:

     * Let’s say that your field is called **"location",** and we want to search for a specific location **“Miami”:**

         * We can set up a query as follows:
**$query = Course::all([ 'meta_key' => 'location','meta_value' => 'miami' ]);**

* **meta_key** is used to describe the field name, while **meta_value** is the value we are looking for in that field.

     * ACF has commands you can use to update fields as well, 
update_field($selector, $value, $post_id);

 * To learn more about how ACF deals with adding and updating posts, check out this link: [https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/update_field/](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/update_field/) 

     * **API Endpoints**

          * You would then have to define an API endpoint as follows:
**$api->get([ 'path' => '/courses/location/miami', 'controller' => 'SampleController:getCoursesByLocation' ]);**

* **This is all done in your setup_api.php**

    * **Notice after the $api->**, you will see the method type itself. In this case, we are using a **GET**

        * **path** is what path we want to use on the front end

            * **controller** is the name of the controller that governs this endpoint, separated by a colon, and then the name of the **method** to call.

            * Other methods like put can be performed as well: [https://github.com/alesanchezr/wpas-wordpress-dash/blob/master/src/WPAS/Controller/README.md](https://github.com/alesanchezr/wpas-wordpress-dash/blob/master/src/WPAS/Controller/README.md) 

**Assignment**: Work on your projects. You should have 2 project workspaces and 2 repos. 1 for wordpress and backend, the other for your react application.
