# Event Checking Application

This application allows any BreatheCode user to register the attendance
of any person into particular events.

## Functionalities
1. The application should know all the events that are taking place at the academy (use the [/apis/events]() for that)
2. There is no way to create a new event on this app, this app is only to checking users in already created events.
3. When some arrives to the event entrance there will be someone with an ipad of phone registering people.
4. If the emails is already registered into Breathecode we don't need to ask him for any other info.
5. If the emails is not in the system, the app lets you search for the user by name.
6. If the user is not found, it lets you create a new user.
7. After we have the user created or found, the all needs to use the /apis/events API to checking the user.

## TODO

Everything, this app has not been started
